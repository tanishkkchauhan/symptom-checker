# Symptom Advisor AI ü©∫

A simple web application that allows users to enter common symptoms and receive AI-generated suggestions for potential over-the-counter (OTC) medications. The backend uses Node.js/Express and interacts with an NVIDIA AI model (via the OpenAI SDK compatible endpoint) configured to act as a medical advisor for common issues. The frontend is built with React and Material UI.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer:** This application provides **general information only** based on AI suggestions and **does not constitute professional medical advice**. The recommendations are generated by an AI model and may not be accurate, complete, or appropriate for your specific health condition. **Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider** for any health concerns, diagnosis, or before starting any new treatment or medication. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of information obtained from this application.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Symptom Input:** Enter one or more symptoms separated by commas.
*   **Symptom Chips:** Visual representation of entered symptoms.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Sends symptoms to a backend API which queries an NVIDIA AI model for OTC medication suggestions.
*   **Backend API:** Node.js/Express server handling API requests.
*   **AI Configuration:** Uses the `openai` Node.js library to connect to NVIDIA's API endpoint, with a specific system prompt guiding the AI to act as a medical professional for common symptoms and OTC meds.
*   **Frontend Interface:** Clean UI built with React and Material UI.
*   **Loading & Error Handling:** Provides feedback during API calls and displays errors if they occur.
*   **Server Health Check:** Frontend checks if the backend server is responsive on load.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   An NVIDIA API Key (See [NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover) or similar documentation for obtaining a key)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Barrsum/symptom-checker.git
    cd symptom-checker
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend (`server` directory):**
    *   Navigate to the server directory (you might need to create one and move `server.js` into it):
        ```bash
        # If server.js is in the root, create a server directory and move it
        mkdir server
        mv server.js server/
        cd server
        ```
    *   Initialize npm and install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm init -y # If you don't have a package.json yet
        npm install express cors openai dotenv
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
        ```
        touch .env
        ```
    *   Add your NVIDIA API key to the `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        # server/.env
        NVIDIA_API_KEY=YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY_HERE
        PORT=5101
        ```
        *(Replace `YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key)*

3.  **Setup Frontend (root directory or a `client` directory):**
    *   Navigate back to the root directory (or into your `client` directory if you have one):
        ```bash
        cd .. # If you were in server/
        # If your React files are in the root and you have no package.json:
        # npm init -y
        ```
    *   Install frontend dependencies (assuming you have a `package.json` from Vite/CRA):
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        # yarn install
        ```
        *(If you don't have a `package.json` for the frontend yet, you might need to set up a React project using Vite: `npm create vite@latest . --template react` and then move your existing `src` files, `index.css`, `App.css` into it, then run `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`)*

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   Open a terminal, navigate to the `server` directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        node server.js
        ```
    *   You should see output like: `Server running on http://localhost:5101`

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    *   Open *another* terminal, navigate to the frontend directory (root or `client`):
        ```bash
        # If in the root directory
        npm run dev # (or yarn dev, depends on your setup)
        ```
    *   Vite (or your dev server) will typically output the URL to access the app, usually: `http://localhost:5173`

3.  **Access the App:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

*(Note: Your current structure might have `server.js` and the React files mixed in the root. Consider organizing them into `server` and `src` (or `client`) directories for better maintainability.)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

*   **Backend Port:** Defined in `server/.env` or defaults to `5101`.
*   **NVIDIA API Key:** Must be set in `server/.env` as `NVIDIA_API_KEY`.
*   **Allowed Origins (CORS):** Configured in `server.js` to allow requests from `http://localhost:5173` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. Modify `corsOptions` in `server.js` if deploying or using different frontend ports.
*   **AI Model:** Set in `server.js` (`nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct`). Can be changed if needed.
*   **System Prompt:** Defined as `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `server.js`. Modifying this will change the AI's behavior and persona.
